1,Acadia Carriage Roads,Bar Harbor,Maine,44.32066,-68.25325,45,"OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven.   Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.  The carriage roads in Acadia National Park are located on Mt. Desert Island, off the coast of Maine.  There are several points of entry off of Rt. 233, all marked with brown signs.  Rt. 233 will also take you directly into Bar Harbor, ME.  To get to 233, you can take Rt 3 East from I-95N, and then 3 to 3/198.  Once you have passed through Ellsworth, continue on 3/198 towards Trenton and Bar Harbor.   Or, refer to Rand MacNalley like we did.

52,Acadia Carriage Roads,Bar Harbor,Maine,44.32066,-68.25325,45,"OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven.   Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.

61,Acadia Carriage Roads,Bar Harbor,Maine,44.32066,-68.25325,45,"OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven.   Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.

Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.

The mountain's summit is bare and flat with 360 degree views, including dramatic views over Frenchman Bay and Mount Desert Island. The most direct route up Schoodic Mountain leaves from the rear of the Schoodic Beach parking area. However, a popular route on a hot summer day combines an ascent from the parking area with a descent to Schoodic Beach for a refreshing swim before the half-mile walk back to the parking area. The western half of Schoodic Mountain's summit, including the communications tower, is private property. Please respect our neighbors and stay on marked trails.<br /><br />Black Mountain<br />The Black Mountain Cliffs Loop (2.9 miles - allow 2 hours) starts at the Schoodic Beach parking area, a popular trailhead leading to Schoodic Mountain, Schoodic Beach on Donnell Pond, and Black Mountain.

Multiple access points mean that hikers can combine different sections of the loop into unique experiences.

Trail and then loops for one mile around Salmon Pond. This trail, while still involving travel over rocks, roots, and bog-bridging does not include significant climbing. It passes by Salmon and Little Long Pond while being only a short walk from Mud Pond (via the main Tunk Mt. Trail).

The mountain's summit is bare and flat with 360 degree views, including dramatic views over Frenchman Bay and Mount Desert Island. The most direct route up Schoodic Mountain leaves from the rear of the Schoodic Beach parking area. However, a popular route on a hot summer day combines an ascent from the parking area with a descent to Schoodic Beach for a refreshing swim before the half-mile walk back to the parking area. The western half of Schoodic Mountain's summit, including the communications tower, is private property. Please respect our neighbors and stay on marked trails.<br /><br />Black Mountain<br />The Black Mountain Cliffs Loop (2.9 miles - allow 2 hours) starts at the Schoodic Beach parking area, a popular trailhead leading to Schoodic Mountain, Schoodic Beach on Donnell Pond, and Black Mountain. The loop includes a roughly half-mile walk to Schoodic Beach from the parking area as well as 2.4 miles of hiking trail leading up to and back from the cliffs on the southwest flank of Black Mt. The loop also offers a trail link to Black Mt.'s western summit and the Caribou Loop Trail.<br /><br />The Big Chief Trail (2.6 miles - allow 2 hours) on Black Mountain starts 2.2 miles down the Black Mountain Road, at a small trailhead parking area. It climbs steadily for approximately 0.6 miles through mixed woods and transitions into spruce and fir shortly before crossing onto open ledges with extensive views over the southern half of Tunk Lake and on towards the coast. A 1.4 mile loop around tiny Wizard Pond using a portion of the interconnected Caribou Loop Trail includes a stop atop Black Mt.'s attractive East Peak before returning to the 0.6 mile trail segment leading back to the trailhead.<br /><br />Caribou Loop Trail<br />The Caribou Loop Trail (minimum 7 miles - allow 6-8 hours) ties together rugged Black and Caribou Mountains to create over 6 miles of backcountry hiking in Downeast Maine. The core loop is 6.1 miles, though hikers will need to add at least 0.9 miles of trail (one-way) to reach the core loop. Multiple access points mean that hikers can combine different sections of the loop into unique experiences. Access points include the Schoodic Beach/Mt. and Big Chief trailheads as well as the Caribou Mt. Trail, a 0.9 mile trail located approximately 1 mile down the Dynamite Brook Rd (accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield).<br /><br />Tunk Mountain<br />The new Tunk Mt. and Hidden Ponds Trails provide the opportunity to explore scenic ponds and climb a low but brawny mountain with inspiring views.<br /><br />The Tunk Mt. Trail (3.2 miles roundtrip - allow 3 hours) is an up and back hike involving some steep climbing once above Mud Pond (reached at approximately 0.7 miles). Several vista points with wide-ranging views southward are encountered on the climb. The upper summit area, including a vista northward, is on property owned by the Nature Conservancy.<br /><br />The Hidden Ponds Trail (2 miles roundtrip - allow 1-2 hours) uses the first half-mile of the Tunk Mt. Trail and then loops for one mile around Salmon Pond. This trail, while still involving travel over rocks, roots, and bog-bridging does not include significant climbing. It passes by Salmon and Little Long Pond while being only a short walk from Mud Pond (via the main Tunk Mt. Trail). An interpretive brochure further describing the trail's ecology and geology can be downloaded. The Tunk Mt./Hidden Ponds Trailhead is accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield. Hikers can link in to the Caribou Loop Trail by walking south on the Dynamite Brook Rd. for roughly one mile.<br /><br />Downeast Sunrise Trail<br />The Downeast Sunrise Trail is an 85-mile scenic rail trail running along the entire Downeast coastal area connecting multiple scenic conservation areas, intersecting salmon rivers, and providing year round recreation opportunities. It is open to snowmobiles, ATVs, horse-back riders, skiers, hikers, bikers, walkers, and joggers.

142,Acadia Carriage Roads,Bar Harbor,Maine,44.32066,-68.25325,45,"OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven.   Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.

The mountain's summit is bare and flat with 360 degree views, including dramatic views over Frenchman Bay and Mount Desert Island. The most direct route up Schoodic Mountain leaves from the rear of the Schoodic Beach parking area. However, a popular route on a hot summer day combines an ascent from the parking area with a descent to Schoodic Beach for a refreshing swim before the half-mile walk back to the parking area. The western half of Schoodic Mountain's summit, including the communications tower, is private property. Please respect our neighbors and stay on marked trails.<br /><br />Black Mountain<br />The Black Mountain Cliffs Loop (2.9 miles - allow 2 hours) starts at the Schoodic Beach parking area, a popular trailhead leading to Schoodic Mountain, Schoodic Beach on Donnell Pond, and Black Mountain. The loop includes a roughly half-mile walk to Schoodic Beach from the parking area as well as 2.4 miles of hiking trail leading up to and back from the cliffs on the southwest flank of Black Mt. The loop also offers a trail link to Black Mt.'s western summit and the Caribou Loop Trail.<br /><br />The Big Chief Trail (2.6 miles - allow 2 hours) on Black Mountain starts 2.2 miles down the Black Mountain Road, at a small trailhead parking area. It climbs steadily for approximately 0.6 miles through mixed woods and transitions into spruce and fir shortly before crossing onto open ledges with extensive views over the southern half of Tunk Lake and on towards the coast. A 1.4 mile loop around tiny Wizard Pond using a portion of the interconnected Caribou Loop Trail includes a stop atop Black Mt.'s attractive East Peak before returning to the 0.6 mile trail segment leading back to the trailhead.<br /><br />Caribou Loop Trail<br />The Caribou Loop Trail (minimum 7 miles - allow 6-8 hours) ties together rugged Black and Caribou Mountains to create over 6 miles of backcountry hiking in Downeast Maine. The core loop is 6.1 miles, though hikers will need to add at least 0.9 miles of trail (one-way) to reach the core loop. Multiple access points mean that hikers can combine different sections of the loop into unique experiences. Access points include the Schoodic Beach/Mt. and Big Chief trailheads as well as the Caribou Mt. Trail, a 0.9 mile trail located approximately 1 mile down the Dynamite Brook Rd (accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield).<br /><br />Tunk Mountain<br />The new Tunk Mt. and Hidden Ponds Trails provide the opportunity to explore scenic ponds and climb a low but brawny mountain with inspiring views.<br /><br />The Tunk Mt. Trail (3.2 miles roundtrip - allow 3 hours) is an up and back hike involving some steep climbing once above Mud Pond (reached at approximately 0.7 miles). Several vista points with wide-ranging views southward are encountered on the climb. The upper summit area, including a vista northward, is on property owned by the Nature Conservancy.<br /><br />The Hidden Ponds Trail (2 miles roundtrip - allow 1-2 hours) uses the first half-mile of the Tunk Mt. Trail and then loops for one mile around Salmon Pond. This trail, while still involving travel over rocks, roots, and bog-bridging does not include significant climbing. It passes by Salmon and Little Long Pond while being only a short walk from Mud Pond (via the main Tunk Mt. Trail). An interpretive brochure further describing the trail's ecology and geology can be downloaded. The Tunk Mt./Hidden Ponds Trailhead is accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield. Hikers can link in to the Caribou Loop Trail by walking south on the Dynamite Brook Rd. for roughly one mile.<br /><br />Downeast Sunrise Trail<br />The Downeast Sunrise Trail is an 85-mile scenic rail trail running along the entire Downeast coastal area connecting multiple scenic conservation areas, intersecting salmon rivers, and providing year round recreation opportunities. It is open to snowmobiles, ATVs, horse-back riders, skiers, hikers, bikers, walkers, and joggers. Between Franklin and Cherryfield (where there are parking areas/trailheads), it passes through several sections of the Donnell Pond Public Lands. Shared-use roads open to vehicular and recreational trail use link the Sunrise Trail with other destinations within Donnell Pond Public Lands.",Access is twelve miles east of Ellsworth off Route 182 or 183.,"{hiking,camping}",,

252,Acadia Carriage Roads,Bar Harbor,Maine,44.32066,-68.25325,45,"OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven.   Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.  The carriage roads in Acadia National Park are located on Mt. Desert Island, off the coast of Maine.  There are several points of entry off of Rt. 233, all marked with brown signs.  Rt. 233 will also take you directly into Bar Harbor, ME.  To get to 233, you can take Rt 3 East from I-95N, and then 3 to 3/198.  Once you have passed through Ellsworth, continue on 3/198 towards Trenton and Bar Harbor.   Or, refer to Rand MacNalley like we did.  In the off season, lodging from bed and breakfasts, to waterfront cabins, to KOA campgrounds can be found anywhere.  ","{""mountain biking"",hiking}",,

Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.

Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.

The mountain's summit is bare and flat with 360 degree views, including dramatic views over Frenchman Bay and Mount Desert Island. The most direct route up Schoodic Mountain leaves from the rear of the Schoodic Beach parking area. However, a popular route on a hot summer day combines an ascent from the parking area with a descent to Schoodic Beach for a refreshing swim before the half-mile walk back to the parking area. The western half of Schoodic Mountain's summit, including the communications tower, is private property. Please respect our neighbors and stay on marked trails.<br /><br />Black Mountain<br />The Black Mountain Cliffs Loop (2.9 miles - allow 2 hours) starts at the Schoodic Beach parking area, a popular trailhead leading to Schoodic Mountain, Schoodic Beach on Donnell Pond, and Black Mountain. The loop includes a roughly half-mile walk to Schoodic Beach from the parking area as well as 2.4 miles of hiking trail leading up to and back from the cliffs on the southwest flank of Black Mt. The loop also offers a trail link to Black Mt.'s western summit and the Caribou Loop Trail.<br /><br />The Big Chief Trail (2.6 miles - allow 2 hours) on Black Mountain starts 2.2 miles down the Black Mountain Road, at a small trailhead parking area. It climbs steadily for approximately 0.6 miles through mixed woods and transitions into spruce and fir shortly before crossing onto open ledges with extensive views over the southern half of Tunk Lake and on towards the coast. A 1.4 mile loop around tiny Wizard Pond using a portion of the interconnected Caribou Loop Trail includes a stop atop Black Mt.'s attractive East Peak before returning to the 0.6 mile trail segment leading back to the trailhead.<br /><br />Caribou Loop Trail<br />The Caribou Loop Trail (minimum 7 miles - allow 6-8 hours) ties together rugged Black and Caribou Mountains to create over 6 miles of backcountry hiking in Downeast Maine. The core loop is 6.1 miles, though hikers will need to add at least 0.9 miles of trail (one-way) to reach the core loop. Multiple access points mean that hikers can combine different sections of the loop into unique experiences. Access points include the Schoodic Beach/Mt. and Big Chief trailheads as well as the Caribou Mt. Trail, a 0.9 mile trail located approximately 1 mile down the Dynamite Brook Rd (accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield).<br /><br />Tunk Mountain<br />The new Tunk Mt. and Hidden Ponds Trails provide the opportunity to explore scenic ponds and climb a low but brawny mountain with inspiring views.<br /><br />The Tunk Mt. Trail (3.2 miles roundtrip - allow 3 hours) is an up and back hike involving some steep climbing once above Mud Pond (reached at approximately 0.7 miles). Several vista points with wide-ranging views southward are encountered on the climb. The upper summit area, including a vista northward, is on property owned by the Nature Conservancy.<br /><br />The Hidden Ponds Trail (2 miles roundtrip - allow 1-2 hours) uses the first half-mile of the Tunk Mt. Trail and then loops for one mile around Salmon Pond. This trail, while still involving travel over rocks, roots, and bog-bridging does not include significant climbing. It passes by Salmon and Little Long Pond while being only a short walk from Mud Pond (via the main Tunk Mt. Trail). An interpretive brochure further describing the trail's ecology and geology can be downloaded. The Tunk Mt./Hidden Ponds Trailhead is accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield.

It is open to snowmobiles, ATVs, horse-back riders, skiers, hikers, bikers, walkers, and joggers. Between Franklin and Cherryfield (where there are parking areas/trailheads), it passes through several sections of the Donnell Pond Public Lands.

Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).

Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.

281,Acadia Carriage Roads,Bar Harbor,Maine,44.32066,-68.25325,45,"OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven.   Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.  The carriage roads in Acadia National Park are located on Mt. Desert Island, off the coast of Maine.  There are several points of entry off of Rt. 233, all marked with brown signs.  Rt. 233 will also take you directly into Bar Harbor, ME.  To get to 233, you can take Rt 3 East from I-95N, and then 3 to 3/198.  Once you have passed through Ellsworth, continue on 3/198 towards Trenton and Bar Harbor.   Or, refer to Rand MacNalley like we did.  In the off season, lodging from bed and breakfasts, to waterfront cabins, to KOA campgrounds can be found anywhere.  ","{""mountain biking"",hiking}",,

The mountain's summit is bare and flat with 360 degree views, including dramatic views over Frenchman Bay and Mount Desert Island. The most direct route up Schoodic Mountain leaves from the rear of the Schoodic Beach parking area. However, a popular route on a hot summer day combines an ascent from the parking area with a descent to Schoodic Beach for a refreshing swim before the half-mile walk back to the parking area. The western half of Schoodic Mountain's summit, including the communications tower, is private property. Please respect our neighbors and stay on marked trails.<br /><br />Black Mountain<br />The Black Mountain Cliffs Loop (2.9 miles - allow 2 hours) starts at the Schoodic Beach parking area, a popular trailhead leading to Schoodic Mountain, Schoodic Beach on Donnell Pond, and Black Mountain.

It climbs steadily for approximately 0.6 miles through mixed woods and transitions into spruce and fir shortly before crossing onto open ledges with extensive views over the southern half of Tunk Lake and on towards the coast. A 1.4 mile loop around tiny Wizard Pond using a portion of the interconnected Caribou Loop Trail includes a stop atop Black Mt.'s attractive East Peak before returning to the 0.6 mile trail segment leading back to the trailhead.<br /><br />Caribou Loop Trail<br />The Caribou Loop Trail (minimum 7 miles - allow 6-8 hours) ties together rugged Black and Caribou Mountains to create over 6 miles of backcountry hiking in Downeast Maine. The core loop is 6.1 miles, though hikers will need to add at least 0.9 miles of trail (one-way) to reach the core loop. Multiple access points mean that hikers can combine different sections of the loop into unique experiences. Access points include the Schoodic Beach/Mt. and Big Chief trailheads as well as the Caribou Mt.

Several vista points with wide-ranging views southward are encountered on the climb. The upper summit area, including a vista northward, is on property owned by the Nature Conservancy.<br /><br />The Hidden Ponds Trail (2 miles roundtrip - allow 1-2 hours) uses the first half-mile of the Tunk Mt. Trail and then loops for one mile around Salmon Pond. This trail, while still involving travel over rocks, roots, and bog-bridging does not include significant climbing. It passes by Salmon and Little Long Pond while being only a short walk from Mud Pond (via the main Tunk Mt. Trail). An interpretive brochure further describing the trail's ecology and geology can be downloaded. The Tunk Mt./Hidden Ponds Trailhead is accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield. Hikers can link in to the Caribou Loop Trail by walking south on the Dynamite Brook Rd. for roughly one mile.<br /><br />Downeast Sunrise Trail<br />The Downeast Sunrise Trail is an 85-mile scenic rail trail running along the entire Downeast coastal area connecting multiple scenic conservation areas, intersecting salmon rivers, and providing year round recreation opportunities. It is open to snowmobiles, ATVs, horse-back riders, skiers, hikers, bikers, walkers, and joggers.

Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).

Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.

362,Acadia Carriage Roads,Bar Harbor,Maine,44.32066,-68.25325,45,"OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven.   Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.

Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.

450,Donnell Pond Public Reserved Land,Ellsworth,Maine,44.583306,-68.091251,105,"Schoodic Mountain<br />Schoodic Mt. can be climbed as a loop (2.8 miles) or an up and back (2.5 miles). Allow 2 hours. The mountain's summit is bare and flat with 360 degree views, including dramatic views over Frenchman Bay and Mount Desert Island. The most direct route up Schoodic Mountain leaves from the rear of the Schoodic Beach parking area. However, a popular route on a hot summer day combines an ascent from the parking area with a descent to Schoodic Beach for a refreshing swim before the half-mile walk back to the parking area. The western half of Schoodic Mountain's summit, including the communications tower, is private property. Please respect our neighbors and stay on marked trails.<br /><br />Black Mountain<br />The Black Mountain Cliffs Loop (2.9 miles - allow 2 hours) starts at the Schoodic Beach parking area, a popular trailhead leading to Schoodic Mountain, Schoodic Beach on Donnell Pond, and Black Mountain. The loop includes a roughly half-mile walk to Schoodic Beach from the parking area as well as 2.4 miles of hiking trail leading up to and back from the cliffs on the southwest flank of Black Mt. The loop also offers a trail link to Black Mt.'s western summit and the Caribou Loop Trail.<br /><br />The Big Chief Trail (2.6 miles - allow 2 hours) on Black Mountain starts 2.2 miles down the Black Mountain Road, at a small trailhead parking area. It climbs steadily for approximately 0.6 miles through mixed woods and transitions into spruce and fir shortly before crossing onto open ledges with extensive views over the southern half of Tunk Lake and on towards the coast. A 1.4 mile loop around tiny Wizard Pond using a portion of the interconnected Caribou Loop Trail includes a stop atop Black Mt.'s attractive East Peak before returning to the 0.6 mile trail segment leading back to the trailhead.<br /><br />Caribou Loop Trail<br />The Caribou Loop Trail (minimum 7 miles - allow 6-8 hours) ties together rugged Black and Caribou Mountains to create over 6 miles of backcountry hiking in Downeast Maine. The core loop is 6.1 miles, though hikers will need to add at least 0.9 miles of trail (one-way) to reach the core loop. Multiple access points mean that hikers can combine different sections of the loop into unique experiences. Access points include the Schoodic Beach/Mt. and Big Chief trailheads as well as the Caribou Mt. Trail, a 0.9 mile trail located approximately 1 mile down the Dynamite Brook Rd (accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield).<br /><br />Tunk Mountain<br />The new Tunk Mt. and Hidden Ponds Trails provide the opportunity to explore scenic ponds and climb a low but brawny mountain with inspiring views.<br /><br />The Tunk Mt. Trail (3.2 miles roundtrip - allow 3 hours) is an up and back hike involving some steep climbing once above Mud Pond (reached at approximately 0.7 miles). Several vista points with wide-ranging views southward are encountered on the climb. The upper summit area, including a vista northward, is on property owned by the Nature Conservancy.<br /><br />The Hidden Ponds Trail (2 miles roundtrip - allow 1-2 hours) uses the first half-mile of the Tunk Mt. Trail and then loops for one mile around Salmon Pond. This trail, while still involving travel over rocks, roots, and bog-bridging does not include significant climbing. It passes by Salmon and Little Long Pond while being only a short walk from Mud Pond (via the main Tunk Mt. Trail). An interpretive brochure further describing the trail's ecology and geology can be downloaded. The Tunk Mt./Hidden Ponds Trailhead is accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield. Hikers can link in to the Caribou Loop Trail by walking south on the Dynamite Brook Rd. for roughly one mile.<br /><br />Downeast Sunrise Trail<br />The Downeast Sunrise Trail is an 85-mile scenic rail trail running along the entire Downeast coastal area connecting multiple scenic conservation areas, intersecting salmon rivers, and providing year round recreation opportunities. It is open to snowmobiles, ATVs, horse-back riders, skiers, hikers, bikers, walkers, and joggers. Between Franklin and Cherryfield (where there are parking areas/trailheads), it passes through several sections of the Donnell Pond Public Lands. Shared-use roads open to vehicular and recreational trail use link the Sunrise Trail with other destinations within Donnell Pond Public Lands.",Access is twelve miles east of Ellsworth off Route 182 or 183.,"{hiking,camping}",,

441,Acadia Carriage Roads,Bar Harbor,Maine,44.32066,-68.25325,45,"OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven.   Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.  The carriage roads in Acadia National Park are located on Mt. Desert Island, off the coast of Maine.  There are several points of entry off of Rt. 233, all marked with brown signs.  Rt. 233 will also take you directly into Bar Harbor, ME.  To get to 233, you can take Rt 3 East from I-95N, and then 3 to 3/198.

Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.  The carriage roads in Acadia National Park are located on Mt. Desert Island, off the coast of Maine.  There are several points of entry off of Rt. 233, all marked with brown signs.  Rt. 233 will also take you directly into Bar Harbor, ME.  To get to 233, you can take Rt 3 East from I-95N, and then 3 to 3/198.  Once you have passed through Ellsworth, continue on 3/198 towards Trenton and Bar Harbor.   Or, refer to Rand MacNalley like we did.

Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.

The mountain's summit is bare and flat with 360 degree views, including dramatic views over Frenchman Bay and Mount Desert Island. The most direct route up Schoodic Mountain leaves from the rear of the Schoodic Beach parking area. However, a popular route on a hot summer day combines an ascent from the parking area with a descent to Schoodic Beach for a refreshing swim before the half-mile walk back to the parking area. The western half of Schoodic Mountain's summit, including the communications tower, is private property.

The loop also offers a trail link to Black Mt.'s western summit and the Caribou Loop Trail.<br /><br />The Big Chief Trail (2.6 miles - allow 2 hours) on Black Mountain starts 2.2 miles down the Black Mountain Road, at a small trailhead parking area. It climbs steadily for approximately 0.6 miles through mixed woods and transitions into spruce and fir shortly before crossing onto open ledges with extensive views over the southern half of Tunk Lake and on towards the coast.

The core loop is 6.1 miles, though hikers will need to add at least 0.9 miles of trail (one-way) to reach the core loop. Multiple access points mean that hikers can combine different sections of the loop into unique experiences.

Several vista points with wide-ranging views southward are encountered on the climb. The upper summit area, including a vista northward, is on property owned by the Nature Conservancy.<br /><br />The Hidden Ponds Trail (2 miles roundtrip - allow 1-2 hours) uses the first half-mile of the Tunk Mt. Trail and then loops for one mile around Salmon Pond. This trail, while still involving travel over rocks, roots, and bog-bridging does not include significant climbing. It passes by Salmon and Little Long Pond while being only a short walk from Mud Pond (via the main Tunk Mt. Trail). An interpretive brochure further describing the trail's ecology and geology can be downloaded. The Tunk Mt./Hidden Ponds Trailhead is accessed off Rt. 182 between Franklin and Cherryfield.

551,Acadia Carriage Roads,Bar Harbor,Maine,44.32066,-68.25325,45,"OK, I gave this an aerobic difficulty of 8 because I hadn't done any biking in the two or three weeks before attempting this, so maybe someone in a little more shape would find this to be a six or seven.   Not very technical as these are all car-free carriage roads built  by John Rockefeller, Jr, but depending on the trails you take, you may have to face some 700-1000+ ft climbs on gravel roads.  The views, especially in the fall with the color changes, are SPECTACULAR once you reach the peaks of the climbs.  Coming down is a LOT more fun, though be careful in the gravel - very easy to slide out of control.  Trails are also used by hikers and equestrians, so please follow IMBA trail rules.  Overall, I rate this network a 10.  Great to ride, great views, great history, great photo ops.  Great place for a rigid, or even for singlespeeders after some pain.   Also, great chances for some hiking - bikes are not allowed on any of the hiking trails, and there is no single track riding available on the Island (Acadia National Park).   Also, some of the carriage roads are private, and are marked as such - please respect the markings and do not trespass.<br /><br />All of the trail intersections are very clearly marked, though I would highly suggest purchasing a local map/guide book of the trails, which offer information such as points of interest, trail length, difficulty, etc.  These also enable you to find your way back to your car, and you can create your own 'loops'.   Again, there is some serious climbing to be done.<br /><br />Roadies can also climb Cadillac Mountain in the park - the road up is open from one hour before sunrise until midnight, and due to the tourist traffic on the narrow roads, park rangers suggest that you attempt this in the earlier hours.  Cadillac Mountain is 1532 feet high, and is the tallest mountain on the Atlantic coastline.   Please note that not all of the park roads are open to cyclists.","There are several points of entry into the network of trails, depending on which trails you are interested in riding.  The carriage roads in Acadia National Park are located on Mt. Desert Island, off the coast of Maine.  There are several points of entry off of Rt. 233, all marked with brown signs.  Rt. 233 will also take you directly into Bar Harbor, ME.  To get to 233, you can take Rt 3 East from I-95N, and then 3 to 3/198.
